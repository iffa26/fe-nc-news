## Introduction

NC News is an example Reddit-inspired news site which includes articles by users, comments and ratings.

The news articles you'll find featured on this site are not real!

## Background

This site was created as a front-end project while studying at the [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com), a full-stack developer bootcamp. This front end is the user interface my [back-end project](https://github.com/iffa26/be-nc-news).

## Technologies

This front-end was created with Node.js, React, HTML, and CSS, using [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router) for internal routing and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests.

The [back-end](https://github.com/iffa26/be-nc-news) is a RESTful API created using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex, with full TDD (Chai + Supertest).
